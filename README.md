Pygame projects.

The basic logic and order for each frame of the game:

While not done:
1. For each event (keypress, mouse click, etc.):
    - Use a chain of if statements to run code to handle each event.
2. Run calculations to determine where objects move, what happens when objects collide, etc.
3. Clear the screen
4. Draw everything
