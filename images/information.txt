Any bitmap images used in a game should already be sized for how it should appear on the screen. Don't take a 5000x5000 pixel image from a high-resolution camera and then try to load it into a window only 800x600. Use a graphics program (even MS Paint will work) and resize/crop the image before using it in your Python program.
This file must be located in the same directory that the python program is in, or the computer will not find it.
Be careful about using copyrighted images. If you publish a game with images that you don't have the rights to, that's illegal. If you are creating your own work that you aren't sharing, then it is ok. If you are doing a class assignment, make sure that you check with the instructor for his or her rules around it.
For class assignments, I suggest my students add a comment to the program just before loading the image. List where the image came from as we did in the example above. (Don't list Google as the image source, that's like listing the “library” as your reference source. Find the website the image came from.)
